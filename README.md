# vulkat
Simple game engine using Vulkan and GLFW
(WIP)

## Development
This project is developed on Arch Linux. Dependencies are appropriate for pacman only. Check [here](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Development_environment) for instructions appropriate to your system.
I have tried building on Windows 10 but it doesn't work (yet, probably messed up some libraries).

## Credit for the general layout of the project goes to Bart Uyttenhove and the other lecturers of Programming 2 at Howest DAE.
